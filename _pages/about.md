I am a PhD student at State Key Laboratory of Robotics and System, Harbin Institute of Technology(HIT).

I am committed to ensuring the secure interaction of robots with the world by employing **brain-inspired** machine vision technology, which empowers the robots with **high-speed perception and comprehensive understanding** of the world. My research interest now lies in **spiking neural networks** (SNN), **event-based camera** and so on.

And I am also interested in **SLAM** (Simultaneous Localization and Mapping) and **Autonomous driving** because my research subjects when I pursued my masterâ€™s degree in HIT.
