I am a PhD student at HIT.
I am committed to ensuring the secure interaction of robots with the world by employing brain-inspired machine vision technology, which empowers them with high-speed perception and comprehensive understanding.
My research interest now lies in spiking neural networks, event-based camera and so on.
When I pursued my master's degree, my research interest was in SLAM, Robot vision.
